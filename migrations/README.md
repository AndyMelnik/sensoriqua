# Sensoriqua migrations

These SQL files must be applied to the database used by `SENSORIQUA_DSN` so the app can store configured sensors and dashboard layout.

## If you have CREATE rights on the DB

From the project root:

```bash
cd backend && python run_migrations.py
```

(Requires `psql` not needed; uses Python/psycopg.)

## If your DB user cannot CREATE (e.g. shared Navixy DB)

Your DBA (or anyone with sufficient privileges) must run the migrations **once** in order:

1. **001_app_sensoriqua.sql** – creates schema `app_sensoriqua`, tables `configured_sensors` and `dashboard_planes`.
2. **002_sensor_source.sql** – adds column `sensor_source` to `configured_sensors`.

They can run them with:

```bash
psql "$SENSORIQUA_DSN" -f migrations/001_app_sensoriqua.sql
psql "$SENSORIQUA_DSN" -f migrations/002_sensor_source.sql
```

Or execute the contents of those files in any SQL client connected to the same database.

After that, "Add" sensor in the app will work.
